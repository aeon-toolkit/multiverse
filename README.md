  <strong>The Multiverse archive for multivariate time series classification.</strong>

The **Multiverse** is an expanded archive for multivariate time series classification 
(MTSC), together with supporting code, metadata, and benchmark results. It consolidates 
datasets from the original UEA MTSC archive, newer MTSC collections, donated 
standalone datasets, and associated benchmark results into a single open repository.

The current paper version describes:

- 133 unique MTSC problems
- 147 released datasets when preprocessing variants are included
- a curated 66 dataset subset, **Multiverse-core (MV-core)**, for algorithm benchmarking

This repository aims to make it easier to:

- load Multiverse datasets through `aeon`
- inspect archive metadata and dataset variants
- reproduce baseline benchmark results
- compare against published and recreated results
- contribute new results, metadata, and documentation as the archive evolves

## Installation

You can install from pip, 


```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/multiverse.git
cd multiverse
pip install -e .
```

but at present, the best route is to install from source, since it is changing rapidly.

This repository depends on `aeon` and uses the `aeon` dataset loading interface as 
the main public API for archive access.

## Quick start


At present, the safest route is to install from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/multiverse.git
cd multiverse
pip install -e .
```

This repository depends on `aeon` and uses the `aeon` dataset loading interface as the main public API for archive access.

## Quick start

Install the release package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install aeon-multiverse
```
or install the development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/multiverse.git
```

### Load a dataset

Use ``aeon`` to download data from zenodo and load into memory.

```python
from aeon.datasets import load_classification

X, y = load_classification("BasicMotions")
train_X, train_y = load_classification("BasicMotions", split="train")
test_X, test_y = load_classification("BasicMotions", split="test")

print(X.shape)
```

### Train and test a classifier

```python
from aeon.classification.deep_learning import InceptionTimeClassifier
from multiverse.classification import TimesNet

clf = InceptionTimeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
preds = clf.predict(X)
```
More info and links to aeon classifiers - [`docs/classifiers.md`](docs/classifiers.md)
Multiverse ported classifiers - [`multiverse/classification`](multiverse/classification)

### Compare your results to published results
Load results directly in code
```python
from aeon.classification.deep_learning import InceptionTimeClassifier

```
Or explore published results explored in this repo - [`docs/results.md`](docs/results.md)

### Run an experiment
To reproduce a benchmark run or evaluate a new classifier, start from:


- [`experiments/run_single_dataset.py`](experiments/run_single_dataset.py)
- [`experiments/run_benchmark.py`](experiments/run_benchmark.py)

### Donate your code and published results
